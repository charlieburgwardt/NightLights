Starting with code from Kellie I try to mitigate the effect of cloud cover in 2cmv change detection.
This may take the form of using the cloud mask to highlight areas of uncertainty or
I may discover that just excluding images with more than a certain percentage of cloud cover is the way to go.
The GLT to standard spatial reference code is a first step toward getting the cloud mask to overlay the change detection.
